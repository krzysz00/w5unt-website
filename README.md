The new W5UNT Website
=====================

This repository holds the new W5UNT website.
The website is generated by Jekyll.
The content of each page is written as a Markdown file with a specific header.
See the current pages for examples.
This site uses the [Kramdown](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html) Markdown engine, which provides a superset of Markdown's markup.
The template that each page's content is inserted into is in `_layouts/default.html`.
Please use this layout for new pages unless you have a good reason not to.

This website is released into the public domain.
