This is the website of TAMShams, the amateur radio club of the

Our purpose is to promote interest and participation in amateur radio at TAMS and to do cool stuff on the air.

Meetings during the 2012–2013 school year will be held every Tuesday at 8:00 PM in the W5UNT station unless otherwise announced.
